## 🔧 Contributing & Development & Issues
Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or have a feature request, please check out the [Issues page](https://github.com/durakivan/GUIdbyeDPI/issues). Feel free to fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

```bash
It may happen that Antivirus or VirusTotal displays a warning or blocks the file.

*This is because Windows APIs are used to hide the original GoodbyeDPI and CMD windows and this is a profound intrusion into Windows.
*Furthermore GoodbyeDPI is executed as administrator.

Nevertheless my code is less than 300 lines long and you are welcome to check it or compile it yourself. :)
